version 0.2.0
[Sep 28 2015] - Rewritten gosh. 
                Now it is a two part program - gosh and gosh-core. 
                As a good consequence we complete the TODO #3,4 and 5.
                
                Update the Makefile.
                Now it will print the install/uninstall steps but not the commands.
