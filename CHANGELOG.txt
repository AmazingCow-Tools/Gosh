version 0.1.1
[Sep 12 2015] - Gosh now prints the bookmarks and the paths in a more formatted way.
        		A option to disable the colored output is added, since now colored
		        output is the default.

version 0.1.2
[Sep 24 2015] - Change the makefile to perform a copy (cp) instead of link (ln).
                Fix the colored output to work in all platforms.

version 0.2.0
[Sep 28 2015] - Rewritten gosh. 
                Now it is a two part program - gosh and gosh-core. 
                As a good consequence we complete the TODO #3,4 and 5.
                
                Update the Makefile.
                Now it will print the install/uninstall steps but not the commands.
